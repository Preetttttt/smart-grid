# Electricity Consumption Forecasting Using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future electricity consumption based on historical time series data. The aim is to build a model that accurately captures trends and patterns to make reliable forecasts.

## Problem Statement
Traditional methods struggle to capture the temporal dependencies in electricity demand data. This project applies deep learning (LSTM) to predict electricity consumption using time series forecasting.

## Objective
To train an LSTM model that can predict future electricity usage by minimizing the error between actual and predicted values ‚Äî making the predicted graph closely follow the actual values.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## üìä Dataset
You can use any public dataset related to electricity consumption. For this project, the dataset includes:
- Date or time column
- Electricity usage values (target)

## Preprocessing Steps
- Time series formatted with timestamps
- Scaled data using MinMaxScaler
- Reshaped input for LSTM

## Model Architecture
- LSTM layer(s)
- Dense output layer
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimizer: Adam

## Training Configuration
- Epochs: 50
- Batch size: 32
- Validation split: Yes (using train_test_split)
- Metrics: Training vs Validation Loss

## üìà Results
- The model achieves a close match between predicted and actual values.
- Loss curves show convergence.
- Graphs indicate the model successfully follows the pattern of real electricity usage.
